# This is the sky required for slabtool_test02.
# It is the sky design used in several of the series of HydrolLight runs.
# In Pjod00.txt the quad averaged radiance in the end cap is 2.94286e+01.
# For all other quads it should be identical but varies slighlty presumably
# due to numerical error (in skytool these values are always identical by design). 
# In Pjod00.txt at quads of theta 10 degrees quad averaged radiance is 9.54945e-02 
# and is close to 9.549e-02 in all qauds.
# These are identical to 4 s.f. to the values calculated by skytool, see ang_data_ref.txt.
