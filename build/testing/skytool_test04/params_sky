# This sky is required for slabtool_test02.
# It is the theta=30 degree sky design used in the series of HydrolLight runs.
# In Djol00.txt line 1247 the quad averaged radiance in the solar quad is 3.56553E+01
# For all other quads it appears to be 9.549e-02 to 4 s.f.
# These are identical to 4 s.f. to the values calculated by skytool, see ang_data_ref.txt.
